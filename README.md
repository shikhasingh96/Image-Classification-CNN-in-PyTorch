# Image-Classification-CNN-in-PyTorch

This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories, showcasing expertise in handling unstructured image data using deep learning techniques.

# Key Features
Deep Learning Framework: Built and trained CNNs using PyTorch.

Data Preprocessing:
Used torchvision.transforms for resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Handled datasets using torchvision.datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) and DataLoader for efficient batching.
Optimization: Trained the model using SGD with momentum and evaluated its performance with accuracy and loss metrics.

Explainability:
Implemented Grad-CAM to visualize regions of images influencing model predictions.

Transfer Learning:
Integrated pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet) to enhance performance.

# Model Deployment:
Saved and loaded the model using torch.save and torch.load.
